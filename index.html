            <h2>Why Chobe?</h2>
            <h3>Chobe, the land of of the giants</h3>

            <p>
              Did you know that Chobe is known as the "Land of the Giants"
              because it has the highest concentration of elephants in Africa?
              You can see up to 120,000 elephants at the Chobe National Park!
              The Chobe River is also unique; during the wet season, it flows
              both upstream and downstream, a rare phenomenon known as a
              "bifurcation." Chobe is also one of the few places where you can
              see the elusive puku antelope, which is rarely found outside the
              region.
            </p>
            <p>
              The park's rich ecosystems support a wide range of wildlife,
              including lions, leopards, buffalo, and a variety of antelope
              species. The Chobe River is a lifeline for the park, attracting
              countless animals to its banks, especially during the dry season.
              Birdwatchers will also find Chobe a paradise, with over 450 bird
              species recorded in the area. Whether on a game drive or a river
              safari, Chobe National Park provides unforgettable opportunities
              to experience the beauty and diversity of African wildlife.
